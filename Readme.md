#****Python Error Handling Exercises 

Exercise 1: Basic Try-Except 

Problem: Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and divides them. Handle the 
ZeroDivisionError if the second number is zero.

Exercise 2: Multiple Exception Handling 

Problem: Create a program that accesses an element from a list based on user input. Handle 
both IndexError and ValueError.

Exercise 3: Else Clause 
Problem: Write a program that tries to open and read a file. Use the else clause to print a 
success message if no exceptions occur. 

Exercise 4: Finally Clause 
Problem: Create a program that demonstrates the use of finally clause. The finally block should 
execute regardless of whether an exception occurred. 

Exercise 5: Custom Exception 
Problem: Create a custom exception for age validation. Raise this exception if the entered age 
is negative. 

Exercise 6: Comprehensive Error Handling 
Problem: Write a program that handles multiple potential errors in a banking application. 

Exercise 7: Nested Try-Except 
Problem: Create a program with nested try-except blocks to handle different levels of errors. 

Exercise 8: Retry Mechanism 
Problem: Implement a retry mechanism that allows the user to try again when they enter invalid 
input. 

Practice Tips: 
1. Start Simple: Begin with basic try-except blocks 
2. Test Different Scenarios: Always test your code with both valid and invalid inputs 
3. Be Specific: Catch specific exceptions rather than using bare except clauses 
4. Use Meaningful Messages: Provide helpful error messages to users 
5. Practice Regularly: Error handling improves with consistent practice 
Common Python Exceptions to Know: 
● ValueError: Invalid value 

● TypeError: Wrong type used 

● IndexError: List index out of range

● KeyError: Dictionary key not found 

● FileNotFoundError: File doesn't exist 

● ZeroDivisionError: Division by zero 

● ImportError: Module import failed 

These exercises will help you build confidence in handling errors effectively in your Python 
programs!
