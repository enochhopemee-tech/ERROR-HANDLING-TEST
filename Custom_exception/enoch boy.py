#object oriented programming,is one that has to do with classes and objects.
#it has in it encapsulation,polymorphism,inheritance and methods.
#example for classes and object

def gender():
    print("")

g = 1
print(type(gender))    

#this would result into <class 'function'>
#so if am to change that g to gender = boy
#let me try it

def gender():
    print("boy")

gender = "boy"
print(type(gender))    

#this would result to <class 'str'>
#this for my definition on the basic concept on oop
#Thank you
